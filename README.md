## 🔮 Roadmap

Alkaline is stable as-is, but the **future focus is a Next.js rebuild**.
That means this repo is a foundation and reference point, not a long-term home for contributions.

Planned steps:

- [x] Live demo site
- [x] Accessibility refinements
- [ ] Potential upgrade to TailwindCSS v4
- [ ] Next.js rebuild (Alkaline v2)

## 🤝 Contributing

Right now, **pull requests aren’t being accepted**, since the Next.js rebuild will change the project’s direction, but that may change based on interest and demand.

That said, **discussions and feedback are welcome**—feel free to open an [issue](../../issues) if you have ideas, requests, or spot a bug.
