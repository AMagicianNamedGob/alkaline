## 🔮 Roadmap

Alkaline is stable as-is, but the **future focus is a Next.js rebuild**.
That means this repo is a foundation and reference point, not a long-term home for contributions.

Planned steps:

- [x] Live demo site
- [ ] Next.js rebuild (Alkaline v2)
- [ ] Accessibility refinements

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Right now, **pull requests aren’t being accepted**, since the Next.js rebuild will change the project’s direction.
That said, **discussions and feedback are welcome**—feel free to open an [issue](../../issues) if you have ideas, requests, or spot a bug.
